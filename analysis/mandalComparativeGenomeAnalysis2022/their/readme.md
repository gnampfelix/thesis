# Notes

For this, I've prepared a `list.txt` by applying 
```bash
awk -F "," '{$1}' list.csv > list.txt
```
to remove the second column (the optional label for my tool). Then, I've executed

```bash
mashtree_bootstrap.pl --reps 10 -numcpus 4 --file-of-files list.txt -- --mindepth 0 > mashtree.out
```

To use the tree generated by mashtree, I need to relabel the nodes. I will use [[newick_utils]] for that.

I prepare the map as follows:
```bash
awk -F "," '{print $2}' list.csv > labels.txt
awk -F "," '{print $1}' list.csv | xargs basename -s ".fna" > filenames.txt
paste filenames.txt labels.txt > map.txt
```

and then re-label the nodes using
```bash
nw_rename mashtree.tree map.txt > renamed_tree.tree
```

This is the procedure to generate `mashtree_r10.tree`.
