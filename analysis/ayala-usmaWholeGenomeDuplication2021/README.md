# Summary

Here, I want to analyze the genomes of _P. infestans_ T30-4, _P. infestans_
RC10-1, _P. ramorum_ and _P. sojae_ in terms of any correlation between hash
density in a given window and effector gene density in that window.

For this, I am using the effector lists compiled by Ayala-Usma _et al._
