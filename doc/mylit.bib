  abstract = {Many members of the               Oomycota               genus               Phytophthora               cause economic and environmental impact diseases in nurseries, horticulture, forest, and natural ecosystems and many are of regulatory concern around the world. At present, there are 223 described species, including eight unculturable and three lost species. Twenty-eight species need to be redescribed or validated. A lectotype, epitype or neotype was selected for 20 species, and a redescription based on the morphological/molecular characters and phylogenetic placement is provided. In addition, the names of five species are validated:               P. cajani               ,               P. honggalleglyana               (Synonym:               P. hydropathica               ),               P. megakarya               ,               P. pisi               and               P. pseudopolonica               for which morphology and phylogeny are given. Two species,               P. ×multiformis               and               P. uniformis               are presented as new combinations.               Phytophthora palmivora               is treated with a representative strain as both lecto- and epitypification are pending. This manuscript provides the updated multigene phylogeny and molecular toolbox with seven genes (ITS rDNA,               β-tub               ,               COI               ,               EF1α               ,               HSP90               ,               L10               , and               YPT1               ) generated from the type specimens of 212 validly published, and culturable species (including nine hybrid taxa). The genome information of 23 types published to date is also included. Several aspects of the taxonomic revision and phylogenetic re-evaluation of the genus including species concepts, concept and position of the phylogenetic clades recognized within               Phytophthora               are discussed. Some of the contents of this manuscript, including factsheets for the 212 species, are associated with the “               IDphy               : molecular and morphological identification of               Phytophthora               based on the types” online resource (https://idtools.org/tools/1056/index.cfm). The first version of the               IDphy               online resource released to the public in September 2019 contained 161 species. In conjunction with this publication, we are updating the               IDphy               online resource to version 2 to include the 51 species recently described. The current status of the 223 described species is provided along with information on type specimens with details of the host (substrate), location, year of collection and publications. Additional information is provided regarding the ex-type culture(s) for the 212 valid culturable species and the diagnostic molecular toolbox with seven genes that includes the two metabarcoding genes (ITS and               COI               ) that are important for Sanger sequencing and also very valuable Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTU) for second and third generation metabarcoding High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies. The               IDphy               online resource will continue to be updated annually to include new descriptions. This manuscript in conjunction with               IDphy               represents a monographic study and the most updated revision of the taxonomy and phylogeny of               Phytophthora               , widely considered one of the most important genera of plant pathogens.},

  abstract = {Genetic algorithms instruct sophisticated biological organization. Three qualitative kinds of sequence complexity exist: random (RSC), ordered (OSC), and functional (FSC). FSC alone provides algorithmic instruction. Random and Ordered Sequence Complexities lie at opposite ends of the same bi-directional sequence complexity vector. Randomness in sequence space is defined by a lack of Kolmogorov algorithmic compressibility. A sequence is compressible because it contains redundant order and patterns. Law-like cause-and-effect determinism produces highly compressible order. Such forced ordering precludes both information retention and freedom of selection so critical to algorithmic programming and control. Functional Sequence Complexity requires this added programming dimension of uncoerced selection at successive decision nodes in the string. Shannon information theory measures the relative degrees of RSC and OSC. Shannon information theory cannot measure FSC. FSC is invariably associated with all forms of complex biofunction, including biochemical pathways, cycles, positive and negative feedback regulation, and homeostatic metabolism. The algorithmic programming of FSC, not merely its aperiodicity, accounts for biological organization. No empirical evidence exists of either RSC of OSC ever having produced a single instance of sophisticated biological organization. Organization invariably manifests FSC rather than successive random events (RSC) or low-informational self-ordering phenomena (OSC).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pathogens of the genus Phytophthora are the etiological agents of many devastating diseases in several high-value crops and forestry species such as potato, tomato, cocoa, and oak, among many others. Phytophthora betacei is a recently described species that causes late blight almost exclusively in tree tomatoes, and it is closely related to Phytophthora infestans that causes the disease in potato crops and other Solanaceae. This study reports the assembly and annotation of the genomes of P. betacei P8084, the first of its species, and P. infestans RC1-10, a Colombian strain from the EC-1 lineage, using long-read SMRT sequencing technology. RESULTS: Our results show that P. betacei has the largest sequenced genome size of the Phytophthora genus so far with 270~Mb. A moderate transposable element invasion and a whole genome duplication likely explain its genome size expansion when compared to P. infestans, whereas P. infestans RC1-10 has expanded its genome under the activity of transposable elements. The high diversity and abundance (in terms of copy number) of classified and unclassified transposable elements in P. infestans RC1-10 relative to P. betacei bears testimony of the power of long-read technologies to discover novel repetitive elements in the genomes of organisms. Our data also provides support for the phylogenetic placement of P. betacei as a standalone species and as a sister group of P. infestans. Finally, we found no evidence to support the idea that the genome of P. betacei P8084 follows the same gene-dense/gense-sparse architecture proposed for P. infestans and other filamentous plant pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first genome-wide picture of P. betacei and expands the genomic resources available for P. infestans. This is a contribution towards the understanding of the genome biology and evolutionary history of Phytophthora species belonging to the subclade 1c.},

  abstract = {Microbial studies typically involve the sequencing and assembly of draft genomes for individual microbes or whole microbiomes. Given a draft genome, one first task is to determine its phylogenetic context, that is, to place it relative to the set of related reference genomes. We provide a new interactive graphical tool that addresses this task using Mash sketches to compare against all bacterial and archaeal representative genomes in the Genome Taxonomy Database taxonomy, all within the framework of SplitsTree5. The phylogenetic context of the query sequences is then displayed as a phylogenetic outline, a new type of phylogenetic network that is more general than a phylogenetic tree, but significantly less complex than other types of phylogenetic networks. We propose to use such networks, rather than trees, to represent phylogenetic context, because they can express uncertainty in the placement of taxa, whereas a tree must always commit to a specific branching pattern. We illustrate the new method using a number of draft genomes of different assembly quality.},

Sketches are building blocks for large-scale analyses that consider similarities between many pairs of sequences or sequence collections. Although existing tools can easily compare tens of thousands of genomes, data sets can reach millions of sequences and beyond. Popular tools also fail to consider k-mer multiplicities, making them less applicable in quantitative settings. Here, we describe a method called Dashing 2 that builds on the SetSketch data structure. SetSketch is related to HyperLogLog (HLL) but discards use of leading zero count in favor of a truncated logarithm of adjustable base. Unlike HLL, SetSketch can perform multiplicity-aware sketching when combined with the ProbMinHash method. Dashing 2 integrates locality-sensitive hashing to scale all-pairs comparisons to millions of sequences. It achieves superior similarity estimates for the Jaccard coefficient and average nucleotide identity compared with the original Dashing, but in much less time while using the same-sized sketch. Dashing 2 is a free, open source software.},

  abstract = {Because species names play an important role in scientific communication, it is more important that species be understood to be taxa than that they be equated with functional ecological or evolutionary entities. Although most biologists would agree that taxa are composed of organisms that share a unique common history, 2 major challenges remain in developing a species-as-taxa concept. First, grouping: in the face of genealogical discordance at all levels in the taxonomic hierarchy, how can we understand the nature of taxa? Second, ranking: what criteria should be used to designate certain taxa in a nested series as being species? The grouping problem can be solved by viewing taxa as exclusive groups of organisms— sets of organisms that form a clade for a plurality of the genome (more than any conflicting set). However, no single objective criterion of species rank can be proposed. Instead, the species rank should be assigned by practitioners based on the semisubjective application of a set of species-ranking criteria. Although these criteria can be designed to yield species taxa that approximately match the ecological, evolutionary, and morphological entities that taxonomists have traditionally associated with the species rank, such a correspondence cannot be enforced without undermining the assumption that species are taxa. The challenge and art of monography is to use genealogical and other kinds of data to assign all organisms to one and only one species-ranked taxon. Various implications of the species-as-ranked-taxa view are discussed, including the synchronic nature of taxa, fossil species, the treatment of hybrids, and species nomenclature. I conclude that, although challenges remain, adopting the view that species are ranked taxa will facilitate a much-needed revolution in taxonomy that will allow it to better serve the biodiversity informatic needs of the 21st century.},

Here, we consider the simple model where a sequence S (e.g., a genome or a read) undergoes a simple mutation process through which each nucleotide is mutated independently with some probability r, under the assumption that there are no spurious k-mer matches. How does this process affect the k-mers of S? We derive the expectation and variance of the number of mutated k-mers and of the number of islands (a maximal interval of mutated k-mers) and oceans (a maximal interval of nonmutated k-mers). We then derive hypothesis tests and confidence intervals (CIs) for r given an observed number of mutated k-mers, or, alternatively, given the Jaccard similarity (with or without MinHash). We demonstrate the usefulness of our results using a few select applications: obtaining a CI to supplement the Mash distance point estimate, filtering out reads during alignment by Minimap2, and rating long-read alignments to a de Bruijn graph by Jabba.},

  abstract = {In this paper trade-offs among certain computational factors in hash coding are analyzed. The paradigm problem considered is that of testing a series of messages one-by-one for membership in a given set of messages. Two new hashcoding methods are examined and compared with a particular conventional hash-coding method. The computational factors considered are the size of the hash area (space), the time required to identify a message as a nonmember of the given set (reject time), and an allowable error frequency. The new methods are intended to reduce the amount of space required to contain the hash-coded information from that associated with conventional methods. The reduction in space is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of errors of commission may be tolerable in some applications, in particular, applications in which a large amount of data is involved and a core resident hash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods. In such applications, it is envisaged that overall performance could be improved by using a smaller core resident hash area in conjunction with the new methods and, when necessary, by using some secondary and perhaps time-consuming test to "catch" the small fraction of errors associated with the new methods. An example is discussed which illustrates possible areas of application for the new methods. Analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that allowing a small number of test messages to be falsely identified as members of the given set will permit a much smaller hash area to be used without increasing reject time.},

We present a new simplified formulation of the first step, which aims at computing a circular ordering. We provide the first technical description of the second step, the estimation of split weights. We review the third step by constructing and drawing the network. Finally, we discuss how the networks might best be interpreted, review related approaches, and present some open questions.},

Early detection and identification of its pathways of infection and spread are of high importance to minimize the threat they pose to natural ecosystems. eDNA was extracted from soil and water from forests and plantations in the north of Spain. Phytophthora-specific primers were adapted for use in high-throughput Sequencing (HTS). Primers were tested in a control reaction containing eight Phytophthora species and applied to water and soil eDNA samples from northern Spain. Different score coverage threshold values were tested for optimal Phytophthora species separation in a custom-curated database and in the control reaction. Clustering at 99\% was the optimal criteria to separate most of the Phytophthora species. Multiple Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) corresponding to 36 distinct Phytophthora species were amplified in the environmental samples. Pyrosequencing of amplicons from soil samples revealed low Phytophthora diversity (13 species) in comparison with the 35 species detected in water samples. Thirteen of the MOTUs detected in rivers and streams showed no close match to sequences in international sequence databases, revealing that eDNA pyrosequencing is a useful strategy to assess Phytophthora species diversity in natural ecosystems.},

The last 10 years have seen the sequencing of the genomes of a multitude of species of these so-called filamentous plant pathogens. Already, fundamental concepts have emerged. Filamentous plant pathogen genomes tend to harbor large repertoires of genes encoding virulence effectors that modulate host plant processes. Effector genes are not randomly distributed across the genomes but tend to be associated with compartments enriched in repetitive sequences and transposable elements. These findings have led to the 'two-speed genome' model in which filamentous pathogen genomes have a bipartite architecture with gene sparse, repeat rich compartments serving as a cradle for adaptive evolution. Here, we review this concept and discuss how plant pathogens are great model systems to study evolutionary adaptations at multiple time scales. We will also introduce the next phase of research on this topic.},

  abstract = {Detection of distantly related viruses by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) is bioinformatically challenging because of the lack of a public database containing all viral sequences, without abundant nonviral sequences, which can extend runtime and obscure viral hits. Our reference viral database (RVDB) includes all viral, virus-related, and virus-like nucleotide sequences (excluding bacterial viruses), regardless of length, and with overall reduced cellular sequences. Semantic selection criteria (SEM-I) were used to select viral sequences from GenBank, resulting in a first-generation viral database (VDB). This database was manually and computationally reviewed, resulting in refined, semantic selection criteria (SEM-R), which were applied to a new download of updated GenBank sequences to create a second-generation VDB. Viral entries in the latter were clustered at 98\% by CD-HIT-EST to reduce redundancy while retaining high viral sequence diversity. The viral identity of the clustered representative sequences (creps) was confirmed by BLAST searches in NCBI databases and HMMER searches in PFAM and DFAM databases. The resulting RVDB contained a broad representation of viral families, sequence diversity, and a reduced cellular content; it includes full-length and partial sequences and endogenous nonretroviral elements, endogenous retroviruses, and retrotransposons. Testing of RVDBv10.2, with an in-house HTS transcriptomic data set indicated a significantly faster run for virus detection than interrogating the entirety of the NCBI nonredundant nucleotide database, which contains all viral sequences but also nonviral sequences. RVDB is publically available for facilitating HTS analysis, particularly for novel virus detection. It is meant to be updated on a regular basis to include new viral sequences added to GenBank. IMPORTANCE To facilitate bioinformatics analysis of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data for the detection of both known and novel viruses, we have developed a new reference viral database (RVDB) that provides a broad representation of different virus species from eukaryotes by including all viral, virus-like, and virus-related sequences (excluding bacteriophages), regardless of their size. In particular, RVDB contains endogenous nonretroviral elements, endogenous retroviruses, and retrotransposons. Sequences were clustered to reduce redundancy while retaining high viral sequence diversity. A particularly useful feature of RVDB is the reduction of cellular sequences, which can enhance the run efficiency of large transcriptomic and genomic data analysis and increase the specificity of virus detection.},

  abstract = {Phytophthora cinnamomi is one of the most devastating plant pathogens in the world. It infects close to 5000 species of plants, including many of importance in agriculture, forestry and horticulture. The inadvertent introduction of P. cinnamomi into natural ecosystems, including a number of recognized Global Biodiversity Hotspots, has had disastrous consequences for the environment and the biodiversity of flora and fauna. The genus Phytophthora belongs to the Class Oomycetes, a group of fungus-like organisms that initiate plant disease through the production of motile zoospores. Disease control is difficult in agricultural and forestry situations and even more challenging in natural ecosystems as a result of the scale of the problem and the limited range of effective chemical inhibitors. The development of sustainable control measures for the future management of P. cinnamomi requires a comprehensive understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of pathogen development and pathogenicity. The application of next-generation sequencing technologies to generate genomic and transcriptomic data promises to underpin a new era in P. cinnamomi research and discovery. The aim of this review is to integrate bioinformatic analyses of P. cinnamomi sequence data with current knowledge of the cellular and molecular basis of P. cinnamomi growth, development and plant infection. The goal is to provide a framework for future research by highlighting potential pathogenicity genes, shedding light on their possible functions and identifying suitable targets for future control measures. Taxonomy Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands; Kingdom Chromista; Phylum Oomycota or Pseudofungi; Class Oomycetes; Order Peronosporales; Family Peronosporaceae; genus Phytophthora. Host range Infects about 5000 species of plants, including 4000 Australian native species. Host plants important for agriculture and forestry include avocado, chestnut, macadamia, oak, peach and pineapple. Disease symptoms A root pathogen which causes rotting of fine and fibrous roots, but which can also cause stem cankers. Root damage may inhibit water movement from roots to shoots, leading to dieback of young shoots.

  abstract = {Sketching methods offer computational biologists scalable techniques to analyze data sets that continue to grow in size. MinHash is one such technique to estimate set similarity that has enjoyed recent broad application. However, traditional MinHash has previously been shown to perform poorly when applied to sets of very dissimilar sizes. FracMinHash was recently introduced as a modification of MinHash to compensate for this lack of performance when set sizes differ. This approach has been successfully applied to metagenomic taxonomic profiling in the widely used tool sourmash gather. While experimental evidence has been encouraging, FracMinHash has not yet been analyzed from a theoretical perspective. In this paper, we perform such an analysis to derive various statistics of FracMinHash, and prove that while FracMinHash is not unbiased (in the sense that its expected value is not equal to the quantity it attempts to estimate), this bias is easily corrected for both the containment and Jaccard index versions. Next, we show how FracMinHash can be used to compute point estimates as well as confidence intervals for evolutionary mutation distance between a pair of sequences by assuming a simple mutation model. We also investigate edge cases where these analyses may fail, to effectively warn the users of FracMinHash indicating the likelihood of such cases. Our analyses show that FracMinHash estimates the containment of a genome in a large metagenome more accurately and more precisely when compared to traditional MinHash, and the point estimates and confidence intervals perform significantly better in estimating mutation distances.},

  abstract = {The familiar evolutionary model assumes a tree, a model that has greatly facilitated the discussion and testing of hypotheses. However, it is well known that more complex evolutionary scenarios are poorly described by such models. Even when evolution proceeds in a tree-like manner, analysis of the data may not be best served by forcing the data onto a tree or assuming a tree-like model. Rather, visualization and exploration of the data to discover and evaluate its properties can be an essential first step. Recognition of these issues has led to the development of a number of different types of phylogenetic networks (see Fig. 1). In this article we first discuss the terminology used to describe and distinguish between the different types of phylogenetic networks and methods that are currently in use. There are a number of different types of phylogenetic networks, and this can be a source of confusion. We then provide a detailed introduction to split networks, how they are defined, and how they can be interpreted. We discuss the use of split networks in strategies for dealing with systematic error, especially as a preliminary step to tree-based analysis and show examples of a number of different types of networks. We outline the beginnings of a statistical framework for phylogenetic inference using split network methods. Split networks have been widely used as a tool for visualization but have been neglected as a tool for statistical inference. Their success as a tool for visualizing incompatible and ambiguous phylogenetic signals suggests that if they are properly used, they can become an invaluable statistical inference tool for phylogenetics. Here we describe a method for constructing approximate confidence intervals (CIs) for trees using networks and a simple test to determine whether an incompatible signal in a network is statistically significant. There is considerable scope for improvement of both methods.},

We rst investigate the FracMinHash sketching technique, a derivative of modulo hash that supports Jaccard containment estimation between sets of di erent sizes. We implement FracMinHash in the sourmash software, evaluate its accuracy, and demonstrate large-scale containment searches of metagenomes using 700,000 microbial reference genomes. We next frame shotgun metagenome compositional analysis as the problem of nding a minimum collection of reference genomes that “cover” the known k-mers in a metagenome, a minimum set cover problem. We implement a greedy approximate solution using FracMinHash sketches, and evaluate its accuracy for taxonomic assignment using a CAMI community benchmark. Finally, we show that the minimum metagenome cover can be used to guide the selection of reference genomes for read mapping. sourmash is available as open source software under the BSD 3-Clause license at github.com/diblab/sourmash/.},

Whole-genome similarity metrics such as Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) help address this question by facilitating high resolution taxonomic analysis of thousands of genomes from diverse phylogenetic lineages. To scale to available genomes and beyond, we present FastANI, a new method to estimate ANI using alignment-free approximate sequence mapping. FastANI is accurate for both finished and draft genomes, and is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to alignment-based approaches. We leverage FastANI to compute pairwise ANI values among all prokaryotic genomes available in the NCBI database. Our results reveal clear genetic discontinuity, with 99.8\% of the total 8 billion genome pairs analyzed conforming to {$>$}95\% intra-species and {$<$}83\% inter-species ANI values. This discontinuity is manifested with or without the most frequently sequenced species, and is robust to historic additions in the genome databases.},

Multigene phylogeny based on the nuclear ITS, ß-tubulin and HSP90 and the mitochondrial cox1 and NADH1 gene sequences demonstrated that they belong to ITS Clade 7a with P. europaea, P. uniformis, P. rubi and P. cambivora being their closest relatives. All six new species differed from each other and from related species by a unique combination of morphological characters, the breeding system, cardinal temperatures and growth rates. Four homothallic species, P. attenuata, P. flexuosa, P. formosa and P. intricata, were isolated from rhizosphere soil of healthy forests of Fagus hayatae, Quercus glandulifera, Q. tarokoensis, Castanopsis carlesii,  Chamaecyparis formosensis and Araucaria cunninghamii. Two heterothallic species, P. xheterohybrida and P. xincrassata, were exclusively detected in three forest streams. All P. xincrassata isolates belonged to the A2 mating type while isolates of P. xheterohybrida represented both mating types with oospore abortion rates according to Mendelian ratios (4–33 \%). Multiple heterozygous positions in their ITS, ß-tubulin and HSP90 gene sequences indicate that P. xheterohybrida, P. xincrassata and P. cambivora are interspecific hybrids. Consequently, P. cambivora is redescribed as P. xcambivora without nomenclatural act. Pathogenicity trials on seedlings of Castanea sativa, Fagus sylvatica and Q. suber indicate that all six new species might pose a potential threat to European forests.},

The field of virus genomics, using sequencing data to understand viral capabilities, has seen significant innovations in recent years. However, with advancements in metagenomic sequencing and related technologies, the bottleneck to discovering and employing the virosphere has become the analysis of genomes rather than generation. With metagenomics rapidly expanding available data, vital components of virus genomes and features are being overlooked, with the issue compounded by lagging databases and bioinformatics methods. Despite the field moving in a positive direction, there are noteworthy points to keep in mind, from how software-based virus genome predictions are interpreted to what information is overlooked by current standards.

  abstract = {The ranks higher than the species in the prokaryotic taxonomy are primarily designated based on phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences, but no definite standards exist for the absolute relatedness (measured by 16S rRNA or other means) between the ranks. Accordingly, it remains unknown how comparable the ranks are between different organisms. To gain insights into this question, we studied the relationship between shared gene content and genetic relatedness for 175 fully sequenced strains, using as a robust measure of relatedness the average amino acid identity (AAI) of the shared genes. Our results reveal that adjacent ranks (e.g., phylum versus class) frequently show extensive overlap in terms of genetic and gene content relatedness of the grouped organisms, and hence, the current system is of limited predictive power in this respect. The overlap between nonadjacent ranks (e.g., phylum versus family) is generally limited and attributable to clear inconsistencies of the taxonomy. In addition to providing means for standardizing taxonomy, our AAI-based approach provides a means to evaluate the robustness of alternative genetic markers for phylogenetic purposes. For instance, the 23S rRNA gene was found to be as good a marker as the 16S rRNA gene, while several of the widely distributed protein-coding genes, such as the RNA polymerase and gyrase subunits, show a strong phylogenetic signal, albeit less strong than the rRNA genes (0.78 {$>$} R2 {$>$} 0.69 for the protein-coding genes versus R2 = 0.84 for the rRNA genes). The AAI approach outlined here could contribute significantly to a genome-based taxonomy for all microbial organisms.},

Based on our experience at the Joint Genome Institute, we describe the chain of decisions accompanying a metagenomic project from the viewpoint of the bioinformatic analysis step by step. We guide the reader through a standard workflow for a metagenomic project beginning with presequencing considerations such as community composition and sequence data type that will greatly influence downstream analyses. We proceed with recommendations for sampling and data generation including sample and metadata collection, community profiling, construction of shotgun libraries, and sequencing strategies. We then discuss the application of generic sequence processing steps (read preprocessing, assembly, and gene prediction and annotation) to metagenomic data sets in contrast to genome projects. Different types of data analyses particular to metagenomes are then presented, including binning, dominant population analysis, and gene-centric analysis. Finally, data management issues are presented and discussed. We hope that this review will assist bioinformaticians and biologists in making better-informed decisions on their journey during a metagenomic project.},

  abstract = {Species demarcation in Bacteria and Archaea is mainly based on overall genome relatedness, which serves a framework for modern microbiology. Current practice for obtaining these measures between two strains is shifting from experimentally determined similarity obtained by DNA–DNA hybridization (DDH) to genome-sequence-based similarity. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) is a simple algorithm that mimics DDH. Like DDH, ANI values between two genome sequences may be different from each other when reciprocal calculations are compared. We compared 63\,690 pairs of genome sequences and found that the differences in reciprocal ANI values are significantly high, exceeding 1\,\% in some cases. To resolve this problem of not being symmetrical, a new algorithm, named OrthoANI, was developed to accommodate the concept of orthology for which both genome sequences were fragmented and only orthologous fragment pairs taken into consideration for calculating nucleotide identities. OrthoANI is highly correlated with ANI (using BLASTn) and the former showed approximately 0.1\,\% higher values than the latter. In conclusion, OrthoANI provides a more robust and faster means of calculating average nucleotide identity for taxonomic purposes.

  abstract = {Finding new protein-coding genes is one of the most important goals of eukaryotic genome sequencing projects. However, genomic organization of novel eukaryotic genomes is diverse and ab initio gene finding tools tuned up for previously studied species are rarely suitable for efficacious gene hunting in DNA sequences of a new genome. Gene identification methods based on cDNA and expressed sequence tag (EST) mapping to genomic DNA or those using alignments to closely related genomes rely either on existence of abundant cDNA and EST data and/or availability on reference genomes. Conventional statistical ab initio methods require large training sets of validated genes for estimating gene model parameters. In practice, neither one of these types of data may be available in sufficient amount until rather late stages of the novel genome sequencing. Nevertheless, we have shown that gene finding in eukaryotic genomes could be carried out in parallel with statistical models estimation directly from yet anonymous genomic DNA. The suggested method of parallelization of gene prediction with the model parameters estimation follows the path of the iterative Viterbi training. Rounds of genomic sequence labeling into coding and non-coding regions are followed by the rounds of model parameters estimation. Several dynamically changing restrictions on the possible range of model parameters are added to filter out fluctuations in the initial steps of the algorithm that could redirect the iteration process away from the biologically relevant point in parameter space. Tests on well-studied eukaryotic genomes have shown that the new method performs comparably or better than conventional methods where the supervised model training precedes the gene prediction step. Several novel genomes have been analyzed and biologically interesting findings are discussed. Thus, a self-training algorithm that had been assumed feasible only for prokaryotic genomes has now been developed for ab initio eukaryotic gene identification.},

  abstract = {Phytophthora sp. are invasive groups of pathogens belonging to class Oomycetes. In order to contain and control them, a deep knowledge of their biology and infection strategy is imperative. With the availability of large-scale sequencing data, it has been possible to look directly into their genetic material and understand the strategies adopted by them for becoming successful pathogens. Here, we have studied the genomes of 128 Phytophthora species available publicly with reasonable quality. Our analysis reveals that the simple sequence repeats (SSRs) of all Phytophthora sp. follow distinct isolate specific patterns. We further show that TG/CA dinucleotide repeats are far more abundant in Phytophthora sp. than other classes of repeats. In case of tri- and tetranucleotide SSRs also, TG/CA-containing motifs always dominate over others. The GC content of the SSRs are stable without much variation across the isolates of Phytophthora. Telomeric repeats of Phytophthora follow a pattern of (TTTAGGG)n or (TTAGGGT)n rather than the canonical (TTAGGG)n. RxLR (arginine-any amino acid-leucine-arginine) motifs containing effectors diverge rapidly in Phytophthora and do not show any core common group. The RxLR effectors of some Phytophthora isolates have a tendency to form clusters with RxLRs from other species than within the same species. An analysis of the flanking intergenic distance clearly indicates a two-speed genome organization for all the Phytophthora isolates. Apart from effectors and the transposons, a large number of other virulence genes such as carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), transcriptional regulators, signal transduction genes, ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC), and ubiquitins are also present in the repeat-rich compartments. This indicates a rapid co-evolution of this powerful arsenal for successful pathogenicity. Whole genome duplication studies indicate that the pattern followed is more specific to a geographic location. To conclude, the large-scale genomic studies of Phytophthora have thrown light on their adaptive evolution, which is largely guided by the localized host-mediated selection pressure.},

In the course of developing a near-duplicate detection system for a multi-billion page repository, we make two research contributions. First, we demonstrate that Charikar’s fingerprinting technique is appropriate for this goal. Second, we present an algorithmic technique for identifying existing f bit fingerprints that differ from a given fingerprint in at most k bit-positions, for small k. Our technique is useful for both online queries (single fingerprints) and batch queries (multiple fingerprints). Experimental evaluation over real data confirms the practicality of our design.},

Wilcoxon proposed an equivalent test in the Biometrics Bulletin, December, 1945, but gave only a few points of the distribution of his statistic. Under the hypothesis \$f = g\$ the probability of obtaining a given \$U\$ in a sample of \$n x's\$ and \$m y's\$ is the solution of a certain recurrence relation involving \$n\$ and \$m\$. Using this recurrence relation tables have been computed giving the probability of \$U\$ for samples up to \$n = m = 8\$. At this point the distribution is almost normal. From the recurrence relation explicit expressions for the mean, variance, and fourth moment are obtained. The 2rth moment is shown to have a certain form which enabled us to prove that the limit distribution is normal if \$m, n\$ go to infinity in any arbitrary manner. The test is shown to be consistent with respect to the class of alternatives \$f(x) {$>$} g(x)\$ for every \$x\$.},

  abstract = {I examined three aspects of the cladistic treatment of a set of 17 F1 hybrids of known parental origin: (1) impact of hybrids on consistency index (CI) and number of most parsimonious trees (Trees), (2) placement of hybrids in cladograms, and (3) impact of hybrids on hypotheses of relationship among species. The hybrids were added singly and in randomly selected sets of two to five to a data set composed of Central American species of Aphelandra (including the parents of all hybrids). Compared to analyses with the same number of OTUs all of which were species, the analyses with hybrids yielded results with significantly higher CI. There was no difference in Trees between analyses with hybrids versus species. There was thus no evidence that hybrids would appear to be more problematic for cladistic methods than species. Accordingly, hybrids will not be readily identifiable as taxa that cause marked change in these indices. About \% of the hybrids were placed as the cladistically basal members of the lineage that included the most apomorphic parent. Relatively apomorphic hybrids were placed proximate to the most derived parent (ca. 13\% of hybrids). Other placements occurred more rarely. The most frequent placements of hybrids thus did not distinguish them from normal intermediate or apomorphic taxa. When analyses with hybrids yielded multiple most parsimonious trees, these were no more different from each other than were the equally parsimonious trees that resulted from analyses with species. Most analyses with one or two hybrids resulted in minor or no change in topology. When hybrids caused topological change, they frequently caused rearrangements of weakly supported portions of the cladogram that did not include their parents. When they disrupted the cladistic placement of their parents, they often caused their parents to change positions, with at least one topology bringing the parental lineages into closer proximity with the hybrid placed between them. Hybrids between parents from the two main lineages of the group caused total cladistic restructuring. In fact, the degree of relationship between a hybrid's parents (measured by both cladistic and patristic distance) was strongly correlated with CI (negatively) and with the degree of disturbance to cladistic relationships (positively). Thus, hybrids between distantly related parents resulted in cladograms with low CI and major topological changes. This study suggests that hybrids are unlikely to cause breakdown of cladistic structure unless they are between distantly related parents. However, these results also indicate that cladistics may not be specially useful in distinguishing hybrids from normal taxa. The applicability of these results to other kinds of hybrids is examined and the likely cladistic treatment of hybrids using other sources of data is discussed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Counting k-mers (substrings of length k in DNA sequence data) is an essential component of many methods in bioinformatics, including for genome and transcriptome assembly, for metagenomic sequencing, and for error correction of sequence reads. Although simple in principle, counting k-mers in large modern sequence data sets can easily overwhelm the memory capacity of standard computers. In current data sets, a large fraction-often more than 50\%-of the storage capacity may be spent on storing k-mers that contain sequencing errors and which are typically observed only a single time in the data. These singleton k-mers are uninformative for many algorithms without some kind of error correction. RESULTS: We present a new method that identifies all the k-mers that occur more than once in a DNA sequence data set. Our method does this using a Bloom filter, a probabilistic data structure that stores all the observed k-mers implicitly in memory with greatly reduced memory requirements. We then make a second sweep through the data to provide exact counts of all nonunique k-mers. For example data sets, we report up to 50\% savings in memory usage compared to current software, with modest costs in computational speed. This approach may reduce memory requirements for any algorithm that starts by counting k-mers in sequence data with errors. CONCLUSIONS: A reference implementation for this methodology, BFCounter, is written in C++ and is GPL licensed. It is available for free download at http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu/bfcounter.html.},

First, the new rule is symmetric with respect to reversing the sequence. Second, the new rule is not context sensitive; the decision to mask a subsequence does not depend on what sequences flank it. The new implementation is at least four times faster than the old on the human genome. We show that both the percentage of additional bases masked and the effect on MegaBLAST outputs are very small.},

The environment had the largest influence on the community composition. Soybean genotype did influence the abundance of the hemibiotroph Phytophthora sojae but not species of Phytopythium or Pythium. In addition, from all environments and cultivars, operational taxonomic units (OTUs) classified as Pythium attrantheridium, P. heterothallicum, and P. sylvaticum were always detected.

Performance scores of previous benchmarks were summarized and correlations between methods and performance were investigated.

The search DNA regions with extreme statistical characteristics such as low complexity regions are important for biophysical models of chromosome function and gene transcription regulation in genome scale. We discuss the complexity profiling for segmentation and delineation of genome sequences, search for genome repeats and transposable elements, and applications to next-generation sequencing reads. We review the complexity methods and new applications fields: analysis of mutation hotspots loci, analysis of short sequencing reads with quality control, and alignment-free genome comparisons. The algorithms implementing various numerical measures of text complexity estimates including combinatorial and linguistic measures have been developed before genome sequencing era. The series of tools to estimate sequence complexity use compression approaches, mainly by modification of Lempel–Ziv compression. Most of the tools are available online providing large-scale service for whole genome analysis. Novel machine learning applications for classification of complete genome sequences also include sequence compression and complexity algorithms. We present comparison of the complexity methods on the different sequence sets, the applications for gene transcription regulatory regions analysis. Furthermore, we discuss approaches and application of sequence complexity for proteins. The complexity measures for amino acid sequences could be calculated by the same entropy and compression-based algorithms. But the functional and evolutionary roles of low complexity regions in protein have specific features differing from DNA. The tools for protein sequence complexity aimed for protein structural constraints. It was shown that low complexity regions in protein sequences are conservative in evolution and have important biological and structural functions. Finally, we summarize recent findings in large scale genome complexity comparison and applications for coronavirus genome analysis.},

Current diagnostic techniques provide a useful and precise tool to enact surveillance protocols regarding specific organisms, but this approach is strictly targeted, while metabarcoding and shotgun metagenomics could be used to simultaneously detect all known pathogens and potentially new ones. This review aims to present the current status of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) diagnostics of fungal and bacterial plant pathogens, discuss the challenges that need to be addressed, and provide direction for the development of methods for the detection of a restricted number of related taxa (specific surveillance) or all of the microorganisms present in a sample (general surveillance). HTS techniques, particularly metabarcoding, could be useful for the surveillance of soilborne, seedborne and airborne pathogens, as well as for identifying new pathogens and determining the origin of outbreaks. Metabarcoding and shotgun metagenomics still suffer from low precision, but this issue can be limited by carefully choosing primers and bioinformatic algorithms. Advances in bioinformatics will greatly accelerate the use of metagenomics to address critical aspects related to the detection and surveillance of plant pathogens in plant material and foodstuffs.},

While the caves of Oceania are still largely under-explored, they form oligotrophic and extreme environments that are a promising source for identifying novel species of bacteria with biologically active compounds. By using selective media that mimicked a cave environment, and pretreatments that suppressed the growth of fast-growing bacteria, we have cultured genetically diverse bacteria from a limestone cave in Fiji. Partial 16S rRNA gene sequences from isolates were determined and compared with 16S rRNA gene sequences in EzBioCloud and SILVA data bases. Fifty-five isolates purified from culture had Actinomycete-like morphologies and these were investigated for antibacterial activity. Initial screening using a cross streak test with pathogenic bacteria indicated that 34 of the isolates had antibacterial properties. The best matches for the isolates are bacteria with potential uses in the manufacture of antibiotics and pesticides, in bioremediation of toxic waste, in biomining, in producing bioplastics, and in plant growth promotion. Nineteen bacteria were confirmed as Actinomycetes. Thirteen were from the genus {$<$}italic{$>$}Streptomyces{$<$}/italic{$>$} and six from genera considered to be rare Actinomycetes from {$<$}italic{$>$}Pseudonocardia, Kocuria, Micromonospora, Nonomuraea{$<$}/italic{$>$}.

However, measuring uniqueness, or absence of long repeats, along a genome is conceptually and computationally difficult.

We then apply Cm to the human and mouse genomes to investigate the relationship between sequence complexity and function.We implemented Cm in the program macle and show through simulation that the newly derived null distribution of Cm is accurate. This allows us to delineate high-complexity regions in the human and mouse genomes. Using our program macle2go, we find that these regions are twofold enriched for genes. Moreover, the genes contained in these regions are more than 10-fold enriched for developmental functions.Source code for macle and macle2go is available from www.github.com/evolbioinf/macle and www.github.com/evolbioinf/macle2go, respectively; Cm browser tracks from guanine.evolbio.mgp.de/complexity.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

A dominant method of such string matching is the ‘seed-and-extend’ approach, in which occurrences of short subsequences called ‘seeds’ are used to search for potentially longer matches in a large database of sequences. Each such potential match is then checked to see if it extends beyond the seed. To be effective, the seed-and-extend approach needs to catalogue seeds from virtually every substring in the database of search strings. Projects such as mammalian genome assemblies and large-scale protein matching, however, have such large sequence databases that the resulting list of seeds cannot be stored in RAM on a single computer. This significantly slows the matching process.Results: We present a simple and elegant method in which only a small fraction of seeds, called ‘minimizers’, needs to be stored. Using minimizers can speed up string-matching computations by a large factor while missing only a small fraction of the matches found using all seeds.},

  abstract = {Species is the basic unit of biological diversity. However, among the different microbiological disciplines there is an important degree of disagreement as to what this unit may be. In this minireview, we argue that the main point of disagreement is the definition (i.e. the way species are circumscribed by means of observable characters) rather than the concept (i.e. the idea of what a species may be as a unit of biodiversity, the meaning of the patterns of recurrence observed in nature, and the why of their existence). Taxonomists have defined species by means of genetic and expressed characters that ensure the members of the unit are monophyletic, and exhibit a large degree of genomic and phenotypic coherence. The new technologies allowing high-throughput data acquisition are expected to improve future classifications significantly and will lead to database-based taxonomy centered on portable and interactive data. Future species descriptions of Bacteria and Archaea should include a high quality genome sequence of at least the type strain as an obligatory requirement, just as today an almost full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence must be provided. Serious efforts are needed in order to re-evaluate the major guidelines for standard descriptions.},

The branch lengths as well as the topology of a parsimonious tree can quickly be obtained by using this method. Using computer simulation, we studied the efficiency of this method in obtaining the correct unrooted tree in comparison with that of five other tree-making methods: the unweighted pair group method of analysis, Farris's method, Sattath and Tversky's method, Li's method, and Tateno et al.'s modified Farris method.

  abstract = {Current molecular detection methods for the genus Phytophthora are specific to a few key species rather than the whole genus and this is a recognized weakness of protocols for ecological studies and international plant health legislation. In the present study a molecular approach was developed to detect Phytophthora species in soil and water samples using novel sets of genus-specific primers designed against the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions. Two different rDNA primer sets were tested: one assay amplified a long product including the ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2 regions (LP) and the other a shorter product including the ITS1 only (SP). Both assays specifically amplified products from Phytophthora species without cross-reaction with the related Pythium s. lato, however the SP assay proved the more sensitive and reliable. The method was validated using woodland soil and stream water from Invergowrie, Scotland. On-site use of a knapsack sprayer and in-line water filters proved more rapid and effective than centrifugation at sampling Phytophthora propagules. A total of 15 different Phytophthora phylotypes were identified which clustered within the reported ITS-clades 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 8. The range and type of the sequences detected varied from sample to sample and up to three and five different Phytophthora phylotypes were detected within a single sample of soil or water, respectively. The most frequently detected sequences were related to members of ITS-clade 6 (i.e. P. gonapodyides-like). The new method proved very effective at discriminating multiple species in a given sample and can also detect as yet unknown species. The reported primers and methods will prove valuable for ecological studies, biosecurity and commercial plant, soil or water (e.g. irrigation water) testing as well as the wider metagenomic sampling of this fascinating component of microbial pathogen diversity.},

Metagenomics was applied to identify the difference in the rhizosphere microflora of avocado trees with and without visible symptoms of root rot. Approximately, 446,970 common gene catalogues differed between them, confirming that root rot affected the bacterial and fungal communities in the rhizosphere. The proportion of bacterial genera, namely, Labilithrix, Sorangium, Sandaracinus and Pedosphaera showed a decrease while Phenylobacterium, Rhizomicrobium, Candidatus Solibacter and Silvibacterium genera were increased by root rot. The proportion of fungal genera, namely, Pseudogymnoascus, Moelleriella, Mortierella, Lepidopterella, Babjeviella, Lachancea, Macrophomina, Pneumocystis, Sugiyamaella and Cyphellophora showed an increase while Cryptococcus, Verticillium, Bipolaris, Pyrenochaeta, Rhizophagus, Cenococcum and Neonectria genera were inhibited by root rot. Moreover, the proportion of the top 10 bacteria in the rhizosphere of symptomatic trees was significantly higher, and that of the top 10 fungi was significantly lower, compared to the asymptomatic trees. Principal component analysis based on abundance analysis and function prediction showed that in symptomatic trees, the bacterial community was more concentrated, while the fungal community was more dispersed. The differences in the responses of bacterial and fungal genera suggested that the pathogenic fungi exert varying selection pressure on the microflora. Moreover, root rot affected the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids and amino acids in bacteria, and the global and overview maps, carbon metabolism and processing of genetic and environmental information in fungi, which might result in differential selection pressure.},

In this study, we investigated the effect of root rot on the avocado rhizosphere microbiome, using 16S rDNA and ITS sequencing. Furthermore, we isolated potential fungal pathogens associated with root rot symptoms and assessed their pathogenic activity on avocado. We found that root rot did not affect species richness, diversity or community structure, but induced changes in the relative abundance of several microbial taxa. Root rot increased the proportion of Pseudomonadales and Burkholderiales in the rhizosphere but reduced that of Actinobacteria, Bacillus spp. and Rhizobiales. An increase in putative opportunistic fungal pathogens was also detected in the roots of symptomatic trees; the potential pathogenicity of Mortierella sp., Fusarium spp., Lasiodiplodia sp. and Scytalidium sp., is reported for the first time for the State of Veracruz, Mexico. Root rot also potentially modified the predicted functions carried out by rhizobacteria, reducing the proportion of categories linked with the lipid and amino-acid metabolisms whilst promoting those associated with quorum sensing, virulence, and antibiotic resistance. Altogether, our results could help identifying microbial taxa associated to the disease causal agents and direct the selection of plant growth-promoting bacteria for the development of biocontrol microbial consortia.},

Here, we describe two Basic Protocols that provide detailed guidelines on how to use RepeatMasker, either via the Web interface or command-line Unix/Linux system, to analyze repetitive elements in genomic sequences. Sequence comparisons in RepeatMasker are usually performed by the alignment program cross\_match, which requires significant processing time for larger sequences.

  abstract = {In Bioinformatics, a large group of problems requires the computation or estimation of sequence similarity. However, the analysis of biological sequence data has, among many others, three capital challenges: a large amount generated data which contains technology-specific errors (that can be mistaken for biological signals), and that might need to be analyzed without access to a reference genome. Through the use of locality sensitive hashing methods, both the efficient estimation of sequence similarity and tolerance against the errors specific to biological data can be achieved.    We developed a variant of the winnowing algorithm for local minimizer computation, which is specifically geared to deal with repetitive regions within biological sequences. Through compressing redundant information, we can both reduce the size of the hash tables required to save minimizer sketches, as well as reduce the amount of redundant low quality alignment candidates.  Analyzing the distribution of segment lengths generated by this approach, we can better judge the size of required data structures, as well as identify hash functions feasible for this technique.  Our evaluation could verify that simple and fast hash functions, even when using small hash value spaces (hash functions with small codomain), are sufficient to compute compressed minimizers and perform comparable to uniformly randomly chosen hash values. We also outlined an index for a taxonomic protein database using multiple compressed winnowings to identify alignment candidates. To store MinHash values, we present a cache-optimized implementation of a hash table using Hopscotch hashing to resolve collisions.    As a biological application of similarity based analysis, we describe the analysis of double digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq). We implemented a simulation software able to model the biological and technological influences of this technology to allow better development and testing of ddRADseq analysis software. Using datasets generated by our software, as well as data obtained from population genetic experiments, we developed an analysis workflow for ddRADseq data, based on the Stacks software. Since the quality of results generated by Stacks strongly depends on how well the used parameters are adapted to the specific dataset, we developed a Snakemake workflow that automates preprocessing tasks while also allowing the automatic exploration of different parameter sets. As part of this workflow, we developed a PCR deduplication approach able to generate consensus reads incorporating the base quality values (as reported by the sequencing device), without performing an alignment first.    As an outlook, we outline a MinHashing approach that can be used for a faster and more robust clustering, while addressing incomplete digestion and null alleles, two effects specific for ddRADseq that current analysis tools cannot reliably detect.},

  abstract = {Background As next generation sequence technology has advanced, there have been parallel advances in genome-scale analysis programs for determining evolutionary relationships as proxies for epidemiological relationship in public health. Most new programs skip traditional steps of ortholog determination and multi-gene alignment, instead identifying variants across a set of genomes, then summarizing results in a matrix of single-nucleotide polymorphisms or alleles for standard phylogenetic analysis. However, public health authorities need to document the performance of these methods with appropriate and comprehensive datasets so they can be validated for specific purposes, e.g., outbreak surveillance. Here we propose a set of benchmark datasets to be used for comparison and validation of phylogenomic pipelines. Methods We identified four well-documented foodborne pathogen events in which the epidemiology was concordant with routine phylogenomic analyses (reference-based SNP and wgMLST approaches). These are ideal benchmark datasets, as the trees, WGS data, and epidemiological data for each are all in agreement. We have placed these sequence data, sample metadata, and “known” phylogenetic trees in publicly-accessible databases and developed a standard descriptive spreadsheet format describing each dataset. To facilitate easy downloading of these benchmarks, we developed an automated script that uses the standard descriptive spreadsheet format. Results Our “outbreak” benchmark datasets represent the four major foodborne bacterial pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni) and one simulated dataset where the “known tree” can be accurately called the “true tree”. The downloading script and associated table files are available on GitHub: https://github.com/WGS-standards-and-analysis/datasets. Discussion These five benchmark datasets will help standardize comparison of current and future phylogenomic pipelines, and facilitate important cross-institutional collaborations. Our work is part of a global effort to provide collaborative infrastructure for sequence data and analytic tools—we welcome additional benchmark datasets in our recommended format, and, if relevant, we will add these on our GitHub site. Together, these datasets, dataset format, and the underlying GitHub infrastructure present a recommended path for worldwide standardization of phylogenomic pipelines.},

  abstract = {The genus Phytophthora comprises many economically and ecologically important plant pathogens. Hybrid species have previously been identified in at least six of the 12 phylogenetic clades. These hybrids can potentially infect a wider host range and display enhanced vigour compared to their progenitors. Phytophthora hybrids therefore pose a serious threat to agriculture as well as to natural ecosystems. Early and correct identification of hybrids is therefore essential for adequate plant protection but this is hampered by the limitations of morphological and traditional molecular methods. Identification of hybrids is also important in evolutionary studies as the positioning of hybrids in a phylogenetic tree can lead to suboptimal topologies. To improve the identification of hybrids we have combined genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) and genome size estimation on a genus-wide collection of 614 Phytophthora isolates. Analyses based on locus- and allele counts and especially on the combination of species-specific loci and genome size estimations allowed us to confirm and characterize 27 previously described hybrid species and discover 16 new hybrid species. Our method was also valuable for species identification at an unprecedented resolution and further allowed correct naming of misidentified isolates. We used both a concatenation- and a coalescent-based phylogenomic method to construct a reliable phylogeny using the GBS data of 140 non-hybrid Phytophthora isolates. Hybrid species were subsequently connected to their progenitors in this phylogenetic tree. In this study we demonstrate the application of two validated techniques (GBS and flow cytometry) for relatively low cost but high resolution identification of hybrids and their phylogenetic relations.},

  abstract = {Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a pivotal tool in molecular ecology, evolutionary and population genetics. The power of mtDNA analyses derives from a relatively high mutation rate and the apparent simplicity of mitochondrial inheritance (maternal, without recombination), which has simplified modelling population history compared to the analysis of nuclear DNA. However, in biology things are seldom simple, and advances in DNA sequencing and polymorphism detection technology have documented a growing list of exceptions to the central tenets of mitochondrial inheritance, with paternal leakage, heteroplasmy and recombination now all documented in multiple systems. The presence of paternal leakage, recombination and heteroplasmy can have substantial impact on analyses based on mtDNA, affecting phylogenetic and population genetic analyses, estimates of the coalescent and the myriad of other parameters that are dependent on such estimates. Here, we review our understanding of mtDNA inheritance, discuss how recent findings mean that established ideas may need to be re-evaluated, and we assess the implications of these new-found complications for molecular ecologists who have relied for decades on the assumption of a simpler mode of inheritance. We show how it is possible to account for recombination and heteroplasmy in evolutionary and population analyses, but that accurate estimates of the frequencies of biparental inheritance and recombination are needed. We also suggest how nonclonal inheritance of mtDNA could be exploited, to increase the ways in which mtDNA can be used in analyses.},

Molecular phylogenetic analyses over the last two decades have improved our understanding of evolutionary relationships within Peronosporaceae. To date, 16 numbered and three named clades have been recognized; it is clear from these studies that the current taxonomy does not reflect evolutionary relationships. Whole organelle genome sequences are an increasingly important source of phylogenetic information, and in this study, we present comparative and phylogenetic analyses of mitogenome sequences from 15 of the 19 currently recognized clades of Peronosporaceae, including 44 newly assembled sequences. Our analyses suggest strong conservation of mitogenome size and gene content across Peronosporaceae but, as previous studies have suggested, limited conservation of synteny. Specifically, we identified 28 distinct syntenies amongst the 71 examined isolates. Moreover, 19 of the isolates contained inverted or direct repeats, suggesting repeated sequences may be more common than previously thought. In terms of phylogenetic relationships, our analyses of 34 concatenated mitochondrial gene sequences resulted in a topology that was broadly consistent with previous studies. However, unlike previous studies concatenated mitochondrial sequences provided strong support for higher-level relationships within the family.},
